# RAPatches

Patch repo for RetroAchievements. Intended for back-ups of patch for hacks, translations, subsets, etc. 

Please open issues for requests and/or error reports. However, please **do not** make hash-linking requests here; patches in this repo are for hashes that have already been linked.<br><br>

***Contribution Guidelines:***
- The majority of patches are and should be in BPS format. IPS is allowed due to header nightmares and xDelta is allowed due to being able to handle large file sizes.
- Patches for subsets should be named according to their game entry. 
- Patches for translations, bug fixes, etc. should follow this format (not all tags will be applicable): `[MSU-1] Title (Region) (Base ROM Version) (Language/Patch Type) (Patch Author) (Patch Version)`
- Patches are then compressed to either .zip or .7z, with those following a `GAMEID-GameTitleWithoutSpaces` naming scheme for linking purposes.
- Be sure to include a readme.txt in the .zip/.7z that states which ROM the patch is intended to be used with.
- The readme.txt files should follow this format:<br>

`Use with:`<br><br>
`[Group, such as No Intro]`<br>
`[ROM file name and extension]`<br>
`[ROM Checksum]`<br>
`[CRC Checksum]`
